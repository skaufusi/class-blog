My title is, “Family, Faith, Football” because these are the three biggest aspects of my life right now. My faith in God, my love for and from my family, and my passion for the game of football. These are the three things, along with my academics, are my priorities in life, and are what guide me and make me happy and content.
	 I chose these pictures because I feel that these pictures best represent me. I chose my first photo as a picture of me with my family. To me, family is everything, and without them, I wouldn’t be who I am and where I’m at today. Everything I do and accomplish is because of them and is only for them. I love them very much and dedicate my life and goals to be able to give back to them. The second photo I chose is a photo with me and my parents. My parents have taught me everything I know, and are the reason I am who I am today. At a young age, they taught me how to keep my prioritizes straight and have always loved me and my siblings every step of the way. My parents have taught me to be humble, and inspired me to persevere through any adversities that life throws my way, and most of all have taught me to be kind and loving towards everyone I meet. They made me who I am today, and for that, I dedicate my life to them. The next three photos are photos of my family. I feel that these photos are the best representations of me as well because it shows who I am, a loving family person. Whenever I’m asked about what my favorite hobbies are, the easiest answer for me is spending time with my family. I cherish every moment I have with them, and I feel that all of my family have impacted me tremendously, and have made me who I am today. I chose to include my first five photos of my family because I feel that they are my motivation and have shaped me the most to becoming the person I am today. I am most grateful for them and what they’ve done and the impact they have in my life. The next few photos are photos of me playing football in high school. The first two photos are of me playing football sophomore year, the next two photos are of me in my junior year, and the next two photos are of me senior year. I chose these particular six photos in this order because it shows a portrait of me along with me playing football, and being able to compare myself in the three years. Each of these pictures I chose tell a story for me. These three years were probably the hardest yet most memorable and best years of my life by far, in terms of all the adversity I’ve overcome over those years, along with the amount of growth I’ve had during those years. The reason why I chose football is because football is a huge passion of mine, and I see myself playing and being around this sport in the future. The next photo I chose was a photo of me running track my senior year for my 4 by 400 meter relay team. I chose to include this photo because track has been another big part of my life, and the experiences I had playing the sport have helped shape me to become who I am, and are ones I will cherish for a lifetime. I learned a lot not only from playing the sport, but from my sprinting coach who was like another father figure to me throughout my years in high school. The next two photos are photos of me in my UCLA football uniform. I chose to include these photos because they represent who I am today and my commitment to the program and to the sport. I chose to do a similar thing of putting a portrait of me and then one of me posing in a full football gear. The pose that I’m doing is the “heisman” pose, which is the same pose for a trophy given to the top college football player every year. This photo is similar to that of the photos of me in high school, and show my dreams and aspirations for the future. I want to be the best “me” I can be, and want to be able to grow and become a better person everyday. My story isn’t finished, which leads to the three words at the bottom of the album saying “to be continued…”.
